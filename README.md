# Cancer-Prediction

## Dataset Information:
> * Target Variable(y): 
>>>> Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
> * Ten features (X) are computed for each cell nucleus:
>> 1. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
>> 2. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
>> 3. perimeter
>> 4. area
>> 5. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
>> 6. compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
>> 7. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
>> 8. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
>> 9. symmetry
>> 10. fractal dimension (coastline approximation - 1)
* For Each characteristic three measures are given:
> 1. Mean
> 2. Standard Error
> 3. Largest/Worst
